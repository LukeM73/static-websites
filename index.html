    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p><b>Of Course!</b> Much like most boys born in the 2000s, I was <i>obsessed</i> with gaming. Every weekend without fail I would rally up my cousins and we would all play Minecraft the whole weekend straight, only giving up once one of us fell asleep.</p>
        <h2>Chess</h2>
            <p>My other <i>obsession</i> as a child was Chess! I would spend hours reading about all the openings in the school library just to go home and still lose to my dad.</p>

    <h1>Toys</h1>
        <h2>My X-box</h2>
            <p>It seems obvious that someone so obsessed with video games would have a gaming console as one of their <b>favorite</b> toys. This was the Xbox that would host weekend-long gaming marathons with my cousins!</p>

                />
        <h2>Lego</h2>
            <p>Every <b>Christmas</b> and <b>birthday</b> wishlist always had Lego on it. I would spend hours rebuilding the same set and after a few rebuilds make something entirely new, like turning a city building into a rocket - the possibilities were endless! <b>BUT DON'T STAND ON IT!</b></p>
